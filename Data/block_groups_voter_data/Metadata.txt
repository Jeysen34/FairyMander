## Processing
L2 assigns each voter to a 2010 Census Block on their Voter File. 
L2 provided the RDH with a file that has each individual and their corresponding 2020 Census Block, dated 9/1/2021. 
The RDH joined the L2 Voter File to this 2020 Census Block assignment file. 
The RDH then aggregated the individual level Voter File to the Census Block level. 
The fields were renamed to fit character length requirements (under 10 chars) for joining to a shapefile. 
Processing was completed using SQL. 
The RDH cannot certify the accuracy of any of the information contained within this file.
