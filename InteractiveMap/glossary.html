                The act of manipulating district lines to control political

                being chosen for you. Gerrymandering harms our democracy and

                <p>
                  A measurement of compactness for each district that ranges
                  from 0 to 1. It is the ratio between the area of a district
                  and the area of the minimum bounding circle around the
                  district. To determine the compactness of the district, the
                  score needs to be closer to 1 for the district to be
                  considered compact. The formula which is represented as \( R =
                  \frac {A_D} {A_{mbc}} \) where \(A_D\) is the area of the
                  district and \(A_{mbc}\) is the area of the district's minimum
                  bounding circle.

                  Another measurement of compactness. It is the ratio between a
                  district's area and the square of its perimeter. The closer
                  the score is to 1, the more compact the district is. The
                  formula which is represented as \( P(D) = \frac {4\pi {A_D}}
                  {P(D)^2} \) where \({A_D}\) is the area of the district and
                  \(P\) is the perimeter of the district.

                  The Dissimilarity Index is a measure of minority
                  representation within a district. Each index value indicates
                  how the minority population is distributed across the
                  districts in the state. This metric is measured on a scale
                  from 0 to 1 where values closer to 1 indicate higher
                  segregation of minority populations between districts. The
                  formula which is represented as \( D = \frac{1}{2}
                  \sum_{i=1}^N \left| \frac{a_i}{A} - \frac{b_i}{B} \right| \)
                  where \(N\) equals the number of districts in a state,
                  \({a_i}\) as the population of group \(A\) in a district,
                  \(A\) as the total population of group A, \({b_i}\) as the
                  population of group \(B\) in a district, and \(B\) as the
                  total population of group B.
