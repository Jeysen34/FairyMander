# Before you start
1. Make sure you have python installed. If you're not sure which version, I reccomend at least 3.11.9
2. Install the requirements (for now, just pandas and geopandas) using this command in the TechDemo directory:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`\
`pip install geopandas`\
`pip install geodatasets`

You should be able to run the cells in the jupyter notebook, `demo2.ipynb` now.

Let me know if you have any questions!
